public class LabClass
7. lots of errors, but the main one is 'class, interface, enum, or record expected', the error message doesnt really explain whats wrong
8. word 'public' can be left out without error
9. the word 'class' on the other hand cannot, i think this is because public defines a feature of the class (visibility) so its not entirely required, but class defines the code as a class and so cant be left out otherwise the computer doesnt know what it is
